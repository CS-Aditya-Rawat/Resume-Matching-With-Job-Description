 more spend we seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures as such we have developed various beyond initiatives where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product as such a customer can buy more stuff without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with for example
 our fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow nonfuel purchases relevant to their business like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store so they can finish the paint job
 our toll tag customers can use their invehicle rfid tags to make other on the go purchases like parking fuel and fastfood for our customers these product extensions reduce payment friction saving them time and operational headaches for fleetcor these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products appeal and applicability to previouslyunserved customer segments eg nontoll urban dwellers we also create new product offerings developed internally or in conjunction with partners to crosssell to our existing customer base

Rora (Formerly Ralph),"about rora 

roras vision is a labor market where workers are as informed and as confident as recruiters are when they negotiate central to this vision are rora career advisors who inform advise and help our clients negotiate new job offers promotions new projects and more

this system has been designed for workers to be disadvantaged compared to their employers workers can never expect to be as knowledgable or experienced as companies are because companies employ full time staff to understand the market and negotiate with our guidance the information assymetry can be evened out and candidates can have more mutually beneficial and meaningful conversations with their potential employers to ultimately arrive at the best decision for the right next move in their career

working at rora

at rora we aim to be spiritual capitalists this means recognizing and supporting everyones inner journey as well as their external journey rather than obsessing over going faster and further we intend to grow slower and closer we dont have meetings on fridays and rarely work on the weekends

Skills AutoCAD, Ansys, Cero, CATIA, HyperMesh, DFMEA, MS Office Suite, Fortran, C, MATLAB/Simulink, CNC Programming Experience Dec 2016   Company Name Identified technological changes, key issues, trends, design and refined the vehicle definition. Illustrated vehicle design and highlighted major interior and exterior dimensions of the vehicle concept. Presented a technology plan on the above parameters. Simulation and Analysis of 1-2 Shift Processes of a 6-speed FWD AT, University of Michigan-Dearborn, March 2017. Established a mathematic model for the transmission-vehicle system consisting of general state variable equation, specific state variable equation for the 1st gear, 1-2 shift process and 2nd gear operation. Simulated the launch of the vehicle from rest in 1st gear, initiated 1-2 shift at a speed of 15 mph, and 2nd gear operation for 2 seconds with an open torque converter and a fixed throttle position using MATLAB/Simulink. Reduced torque overshoot by spark retarding, and careful calibration of the oncoming clutch. Further, torque hole was reduced to maximum extent with help of spark retard. Modelling of Vehicle cooling system, University of Michigan-Dearborn, November 2016. Built a Simulink model of vehicle cooling system consisting of four sub models namely, engine operation, air flowrate, coolant flowrate and heat transfer. Determined coolant flow rate, heat rejection from the engine, and engine outlet coolant temperature for different vehicle speeds by executing the simulation model. Computational Analysis of Hemispherical Radiating Fin, Visvesvaraya Technological University, April 2015. Derived heat transfer equations by using two-dimensional conduction equation in spherical coordinates and subjected the same to radiative boundary condition, with constant base temperature. Solved derived equations using Finite Difference Method and Gauss-Seidel iterations by writing a code in FORTRAN 95. Determined Heat transfer improvement as a function of thermal conductivity and emissivity, with and without irradiation. The hemispherical fin starts to radiate heat for thermal conductivity > 3 (W/mK) and absorbs heat for thermal conductivity < 3=\"\"> Engineering Intern   Jan 2016   to  Jun 2016   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City Completed basic and advanced level of training from regional training office of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.

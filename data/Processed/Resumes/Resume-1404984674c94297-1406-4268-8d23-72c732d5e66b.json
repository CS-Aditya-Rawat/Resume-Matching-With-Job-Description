Presented a paper in the university. Trained in hydraulic fracturing and acid treatment Noticeable Contribution: I was involved in a multidisciplinary team for reservoir simulation and development. The responsibilities included: running routine and special core analysis on different reservoir core samples, reservoir characterizations, and reservoir simulation. This project gave me exposure to the following: refining process working of crude distillation units hydro-cracker unit fluid catalytic cracking unit continuous catalytic reforming unit visbreaker unit isomerisation unit diesel hydro -desulphurisation unit. Projects: NATURAL AND ESSENTIAL OILS PVT LTD. Performed the extraction of essential oils from flower called tuberose and convert it to the desired product using an Rota-vapour distillation apparatus, and a full scale quality analysis was carried out in the lab which included the GCMS (gas chromatography mass spectrometer. Noticeable Contribution: Calculated production accuracy, yield and testing equipment to propose corrective actions. Employed statistics to analyze manufacturing vs. requirements and suggest improvements. Prepared work plans and forecast of production/industrial equipment for management reviews and control. Monitored and organized workflow schedules according to manufacturing sequences and standard lead time of production operations. Company Name Performed extraction using sub-critical Carbon-di-oxide for the extraction of Nutraceuticals where I worked in a team of four under Mr.R.Senthil Kumar ( Professor, Sastra university). We developed our own process design to extract nutraceuticals in a more efficient way with better purity. I experienced a research lab first hand and had the opportunity to work in close quarters with eminent people from the industry Noticeable Contributions: Developed accurate, operations-wide measurement standards to increase production, minimize non-value-added time, and reduce cost. Monitored and analyzed workflow, processes, procedures, and line activities, identifying and resolving bottlenecks to maximize efficiency. Created cost models to support customer proposals and cost reduction initiatives. Served on quality assurance team, developing guidelines and procedures to improve standards and performance. Developed documentation system to ensure accurate, timely updates. Company Name This is project involves the isolation of colchicine and theo colchicoside from gloriosa superba seeds and forscolin from coleus tubers and senocide from senna leaves. Developed the industrial process for its extraction and the process flow diagram on ASPEN workbench. Noticeable contribution: Ran safety and quality tests, installed upgrades, performed troubleshooting, created new production units. Used flow charts, graphs, diagrams, reports, and other documentation to monitor and improve the process. Performed environmental monitoring, handled facility safety and functionality, in accordance with regulations, and in cooperation with quality-control and maintenance engineer teams. Coordinated the various tasks of system development - Planning, designing, and integration (including formal testing) and oversaw full transition into production.

    "clean_data": "ENGINEERING MANAGER Summary Mechanical engineer with more than 30 years of progressive experience specializing in economics driven project justification,\u00c2 management and mechanical design. Much of my career has been focused on paper converting equipment and operations developing into roles in maintenance and reliability systems.\u00c2 More recently\u00c2 responsible for facilitating the capital investment portfolio for the Halsey Mill. Highlights Project management Paper converting equipment Facility and plant modifications DMF and Project Work Process Written and verbal communication skills AutoCAD and Excel Accomplishments Start-up of major converting equipment lines with emphasis on long term reliability.\u00c2  Designed and implemented a mill project work process to improve economic thinking and operational ownership of mill driven projects. This has streamlined the mills approval process for projects. Experience Engineering Manager   May 2011   to  Current   Company Name   -  City   ,  State Responsible for facilitating the capital projects plan and process. This has included developing a process to evaluate projects with stakeholders at determined phase gate challenges and developing engineering talent to work within the expectations of the GP Project Work Process. Transitioned into a working manager with responsibility for managing several projects up to the $4MM range in addition to responsibility for the overall capital portfolio. Develop clearly written venture summaries to communicate the DMF and economic rationale for projects Responsible for hiring and developing engineering talent for the organization. Manager - Maintenance and Reliability   January 2009   to  May 2011   Company Name   -  City   ,  State Member of the mill leadership team responsible\u00c2 for safe work performance and contract adherence of a 76 person maintenance group. Included the hiring and development of craftsmen and salaried personnel for the maintenance department. Utilized reliability experience to provide focus on mill reliability improvements in the areas of lubrication, precision maintenance work, sustainable PM processes, BOMs and procedure based job plans. Recognized at the time as one of the most effective converting maintenance efforts in the company with lowest maintenance cost per case in the company. Supervisor Reliability Engineer   November 2005   to  January 2009   Company Name   -  City   ,  State Led the converting PM program with a\u00c2 focus on developing sustainable results by developing\u00c2 mechanical work standards and a job plan library for converting equipment and\u00c2 implementing them into the CMMS\u00c2 (Passport) to support the PM inspection program, parts rebuild program, and the periodic machine rebuild efforts. Led RCM efforts to establish a maintenance and reliability plan for new Perini and PCMC equipment and implementing the results into a CMMS. This effort required educating the team on RCM methodology, facilitating the RCM process with a large team and establishing a vision for incorporating the RCM effort into an existing PM program. System administrator for the Passport CMMS system. Developed tools to understand and repair PM processes, provided training for PM processes. Managed Machine shop including supervision of machinists, and managing flow of work through shop. Process &Tooling Engineer   November 2000   to  November 2005   Company Name   -  City   ,  State Responsible for developing improvements to a laser patterning lamination process that had been recognized as the\u00c2 least reliable\u00c2 process in\u00c2 the production\u00c2 line. Improvements to the web handling design led\u00c2 to an 80% output improvement to a bottleneck process. Other contributions\u00c2 included developing an SPC strategy that reduced variation and increased reliability. Established the SPC system and provided startup assistance for the line when it transferred to Singapore. Designed and started up the next generation laser patterning operation for adhesive film successfully bringing the process on line ahead of schedule and exceeding quality specifications. Led leak testing process improvement efforts, SPC compliance and investigation of correct GR&R practices. Participating and leading task force efforts to understand quality issues in the factory.

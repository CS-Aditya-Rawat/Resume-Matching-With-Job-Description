    "clean_data": "DIRECTOR FINANCE AND FP&A Executive Profile I'm a senior finance leader who thrives when working closely with the executive team in removing obstacles to directing the company beyond targeted growth. Early in my career I learned the value of looking beyond how things are currently done in order to continually search for how we can do things better. Working in cooperation with senior leadership throughout the organization, my finance teams are built with this focus and the results are enhanced analytics and dynamic reporting tools.

Cross has a 169 year tradition of crafting fine writing instruments, A private equity firm held $120M global company, I was brought on board by the prior CFO to create a dynamic finance function as the company transitioned through two acquisitions. Major Achievements: In my first three months at A.T. Cross I developed an enhanced global budget tool that delivered budget on time and at the product sku level utilizing advanced MS Access. Over my first nine months at A.T. Cross I mapped five independent ERP systems and improved the consolidation process from a five week to a five day close. Constrained by systems and with no capital investment required, I created robust modeling and reporting tool utilizing advanced MS Excel and MS Access skills allowing for detailed analysis at the transaction level that previously had not existed postponing a $7M capital expense over the next three years Prior to planned implementation of SalesForce, I am working closely with sales leadership to develop KPI reporting dashboard and lead tracking tool to drive revenue growth while saving $200K. Co-leading supply chain review initiative including evaluation and improvement of supply chain and working capital KPI. Creating modeling tools in co-led effort to review and improve product costing practices. Senior Finance Consultant   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Engaged with four companies over this period ranging from Granite City Electric a small, family-owned company to Staples, Sun Life Financial and Saint Gobain; I was brought in to hold interim senior finance roles and work closely with the executive teams through periods of transition. Major Achievements:. Even with robust ERP systems in place at Staples, the need to bridge various stand-alone systems was identified and I created an inventory database to track existing store assets while enabling real-time \"what-if\" analysis and cost planning related to proposed changes improving efficiency and predictive capabilities. With multiple global ERP systems in place at Saint Gobain, the executive team was looking for a dynamic and robust \"one-stop\", menu- driven reporting tool that I created utilizing Business Objects, advanced Excel and VBA increasing analytical capabilities and key metric analysis. Senior Finance Director   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State A provider of tailored, high capacity communications services, A private equity firm held company bought by Lightower Fiber Networks in 2012 for $2B, I was brought in to develop and lead the finance team and work with the executive team through the acquisitions of Con Ed Solution's (2007) and by RCN Communications (2008). Major Achievements:. Balancing the push and pull between sales efforts and maintaining margins was the focus of the Request for Proposal (RfP) tracking and analysis tool I developed to manage the contract review and approval process. Integrating two processes performed using MS Excel and monitored individually, I created and linked a sales pricing database with a cost identification database to foster improved sales decisions by bringing finance, sales and technical operations together in a formalized review. Telecommunications expenses represent 40% of total operating expenses at Sidera. Ensuring the accurate tracking and timely payment of these customer impacting costs are crucial. I created a circuit inventory tracking database to facilitate accurate cost analysis and reporting which resulted in a zero network outage rate over the subsequent two year period with $100K of estimated annual savings in penalties and fees. Global Engagement & Mobility Solutions Manager   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Worldwide Director of Finance   January 2005   to  January 2006   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State a publicly traded global $3.5BM company providing management and technology consulting services to large companies and governmental institutions. I built and led finance function supporting deployment of more than 4,000 consulting resources across international borders to serve global clients, driving compliance with international immigration, income and social tax laws. Major Achievements:. Facing substantial fines, penalties and the possible discontinuation of operations I worked with external tax advisors, immigration providers, the International, Regional and Country Controllers, the Corporate Tax Department, Legal, the Payroll Department and my finance team to lead the process design behind the accounting related to 31 subsidiary countries. The result was a tracking database and accounting tool saving millions in fines, penalties and lost revenues. A publicly traded $1.3 billion global enterprise networking and security solutions with manufacturing plants in China and Mexico, Working closely with the Corporate Executive and Ireland manufacturing teams I led the accounting and finance operations for the Supply Chain Operations' six activity centers that served four 3Com regions. Director of Finance   January 1997   to  January 2005   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State A $1B comprehensive provider of wireless communications and software solutions to the healthcare, government, large enterprise and emergency response sectors, Originally hired as an Assistant Controller, I experienced substantial professional growth achieving three promotions culminating in overseeing the global finance team including accounting, financial reporting and analysis while working closely with the Executive management team. Major Achievements:. Working with the Engineering and Technical Operations teams I created lease and licensing database solutions in order to maintain FCC regulatory compliance saving the company $1.2M in penalties and fines. Through acquisition the company was operating 13 individual billing systems and the ability of senior management to make timely business decisions was hampered by a slow consolidation's process. With the focus on closing the books and producing standard reporting, meaningful analysis was an after-thought. In order to provide the leadership team with better tools I established a database solution mapping each individual billing system to my data warehouse with an export into Lawson that allowed for a timely and accurate close in less than five days.

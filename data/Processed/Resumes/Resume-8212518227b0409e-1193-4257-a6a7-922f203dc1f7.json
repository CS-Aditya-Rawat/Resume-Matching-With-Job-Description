Updating the OAM, MES, and OEE portals daily with information from the chief technician. Gathering quotes and product\nspecifications for my two assigned projects, red-lining P&IDs in preparation for changes within the plant, and assisting with any jobs that my\nsupervisor needs done. Lead any Management of Change meeting regarding my projects. Projects are as follows: \n-Replacing an automatic valve\nwith a control valve on a condensate tank; adding a differential pressure transmitter to control the tank level; installing an orifice plate in the pipe to\ncontrol the flow into the tank. Responsibilities included obtaining bids for mechanical labor, electrical and instrumentation labor, and DCS\nconfiguration and quotes for instrumentation. The scope of the project was $50,000. \n- Installing an RF Capacitance probe on an existing sight\nglass on a holding tank; replacing a chemical hose with a 316L stainless steel pipe and installing a control valve in the pipe to control the interface\nlevel within the sight glass. Responsibilities included obtaining bids for mechanical labor, electrical and instrumentation labor, and DCS\nconfiguration and quotes for instrumentation.

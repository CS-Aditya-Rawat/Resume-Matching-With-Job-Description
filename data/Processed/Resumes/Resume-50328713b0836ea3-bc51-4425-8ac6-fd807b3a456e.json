Experience ENGINEERING INTERN   08/2016   \u00ef\u00bc  12/2016   Company Name   State Project: Develop a cavings transport model for optimizing hole-cleaning operations. Developed a solids transport model for predicting cuttings/cavings bed height during a hole-cleaning operation. In  contrast to conventional CFD models that typically take several hours to run, this novel numerical model can obtain  results within a few minutes, enabling timely optimization of the well circulation schedule. Investigated the competitive landscape and designed the commercialization plan for the numerical model. Leveraged the experiences from internal drilling experts and aligned with all stakeholders throughout the development  process. ENGINEERING INTERN   05/2016   \u00ef\u00bc  08/2016   City   ,  State Project: Optimize diverter pumping schedule for better production performance after well re-stimulation. Built a simulator to model proppant, diverter, and slurry distribution in a plug-and-perf hydraulic fracturing operation. Derived a simple proxy model to substitute time-consuming CFD-DEM simulations for predicting diverter transport  through perforation clusters. Simulation time drops from 48+ hours to less than 1 sec. Provided recommendations for pumping schedule design in a fracturing treatment. PROCESS ENGINEER   04/2012   \u00ef\u00bc  05/2013   Company Name   City Improve display yield through statistical modeling, process control, and tool modifications. Won Qualstar award in Nov. 2012 by completing two specific yield improvement tasks in merely two months, first time  for QMT-TW to award its engineers after establishment. Optimized sealing process of interferometric modulator (iMoD) display that led to 52% pre-functional yield increase. Increased the up time of panel encapsulation station from 73% to 92% by leading two tool-modification projects  involving a group of 5 equipment engineers and 2 external support engineers from Japan. PROPPANT/DIVERTER TRANSPORT in HORIZONTAL WELLS, UT Austin  Aug. 2014-present. Evaluate the efficiency of proppant/diverter transport in perforated horizontal wells under different slurry flow  conditions using a combined CFD-DEM approach. Developed a multivariate statistical model to substitute traditional CFD model for predicting proppant transport  through perforations at various flow conditions. The computational cost dropped 5 orders of magnitude. Accurately predicted DAS-measured proppant distribution in a field case with less than 10% error. Chu-Hsiang Wu  Page 2 DESIGN and SELECTION of GRAVEL PACK and SAND CONTROL SCREENS, UT Austin  Jun. 2013-present. Develop analytical, DEM, and Monte Carlo models for predicting sand production through gravel packs and sand  control screens. Accurately predicted 6 sand production lab-test results obtained from operators with less than 15% error using the  developed model. Invented a DEM-based approach for extracting pore throat size distribution of complex packings. Results show that the  pore throat sizes within gravel packs are usually between 1/5 to 1/9 of the effective gravel size. The findings  correspond remarkably well with previous field observations and enable further optimization of gravel pack designs. 06/2010   Company Name Designed highly mixing-efficient serpentine channels for biomedical detection.

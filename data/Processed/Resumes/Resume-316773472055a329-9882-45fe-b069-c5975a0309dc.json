Areas of expertise include conflict management, employee training, employee relations, training, payroll and state and federal laws. Highlights Hiring and retention Training and development Recruiting Compensation/payroll Employee relations Exceptional interpersonal skills Compensation administration Personnel records maintenance Affirmative Action compliance New hire orientation Mediation expertise Experience Software Engineering Manager   September 2009   to  Current   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Visual C++, Windows, STL, OOP, MFC, threads, file maps, ATL, IPC, FTP, TCP, HTTP, XML, JSON, services, web services, REST API, SOA, media formats and standards, codec SDK and integration, MPEG-DASH, API design and documentation. BCD spinoff as Imagine in 2013) Nexio video servers and applications facilitate collaborative workflow in Nexio LAN with video servers, services and applications running in various nodes. Media comes from proprietary SAN or generic storage off NAS. Development and team management, Nexio servers' applications (30+ products), Playout business unit: Relocated from IL to CA, took on larger role, and video server applications product suite as well. Led team of 6 from Northridge, team of 8 from Naperville, and team of 8 (indirect report) from Beijing. Adopted Scrum since 2014, ScrumMaster, team of 3 to 6 from Burbank; Naperville office closed in 2013. Team migrated source revision control to Mercurial / Jenkins. Recipient of \"Reuse Innovation Award\" for IP reuse, major factor to Server business unit turnaround. Released deliverables for Nexio Software Suite 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, Global Proxy Suite 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 Initiated, architected and executed SOA from concept to completion to facilitate decoupled clients, 2 web services and 10 services, and selected hands-on projects include: Hercules web service for web player solution based off MPEG-DASH Created C++ engine to process URI, handle sessions, and deliver segmented MP4 atoms (H.264, AAC) Provides dynamic HTML5 player page; JavaScript source based off dash JS. Supports multiple raster sizes and bit rates; \"ready to go\" and \"just in time\" sessions. Team helped with providing C# web service framework, CLI bridge layer, and device testing. Published functional, REST API, and URI specification document. JSON services on TCP stack using C++ as part of SOA Created API framework classes; multi-threaded server side socket classes. Created header only JSON parser on top of open source \"rapid json\" for SAX style reader. Developed new services: Content Manager, Helper, Picon, and Requestor. Evolved as services: Encoder, GPRX, Helios, MB, Scavenger, and Transcoder. Guided GPRX, Helper and Requestor to completion. Published 10 JSON protocol API documents for 3rd party and in-house use. Content Manager service for primary-backup workflows Rules based engine to manage media contents, and metadata updates between two domains. Architected and developed new UMID based solution (gen 2) to meet storage scalability needs. Scavenger, Transcoder for low-res proxy management (C++, Win32, threads, TCP, binary protocol) Needed solution to improve legacy products that required regular hand holding, remained escalated. Proposed new approach, teamed up, and successfully wrote two new products. MediaBase DLL, Nexio explorer for assets (C++, MFC) Guided to optimize original implementation for 200K IDs to meet proprietary storage scalability. Achieved constant UI performance under few milliseconds regardless of user operation. Proposed to introduce \"dta-handler\" architecture in ftp-server Approach helped to consolidate all media formats as one product build, and scalability. Team added one converter DLL per media container format for import and export. Software Engineering Manager   November 2005   to  August 2009   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Development and team management, Nexio editing applications: Led team of 8 from Naperville, and team of 8 (indirect report) from Beijing. Hired, mentored and built core editing team to size of 8, and collaborated with expanded team in Beijing. Established development process document for consistent procedures and peer code review guidelines. Team established crash dump analysis procedures to help troubleshoot hard to repeat issues. Released deliverables for Video Editing Suite 2.5 Proposed architecture, and teamed up to develop server integration modules for video broadcast workflows. Principal Software Engineer   August 1997   to  October 2005   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Harris Corporation acquired Leitch) Architected, designed, and implemented fundamental DLL components for evolution of video editing product, and major projects include (C++, Win32, threads, codec, SDK, GUI): Interactive playback architecture Media file reader and writer components, scalable decoder and encoder architectures. Video and audio rendering engines Hardware integration modules, critical part of business success in post-production space. Interactive picon and waveform drawing components 64-bit and Unicode migration of all modules with over 4 million lines of code. Software Engineer   August 1994   to  July 1997   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State DPS acquired Star Media; Leitch acquired DPS in 2000).

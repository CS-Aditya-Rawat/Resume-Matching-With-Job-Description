BCD spinoff as Imagine in 2013) Nexio video servers and applications facilitate collaborative workflow in Nexio LAN with video servers, services and applications running in various nodes. Media comes from proprietary SAN or generic storage off NAS. Development and team management, Nexio servers' applications, Playout business unit: Relocated from IL to CA, took on larger role, and video server applications as well. Led team of 6 from Burbank, team of 8 from Naperville, and team of 8 (indirect report) from Beijing. Introduced peer reviews, repurposed components, and all 3 teams collaborated as one large team. Adopted Scrum since 2014 (ScrumMaster), team of 3 to 6 from Burbank; Naperville office closed in 2013. Team migrated source revision control to Mercurial / Jenkins, 30+ products. Recipient of \"Reuse Innovation Award\" for IP reuse, major factor to Server business unit turnaround. Released deliverables for Nexio Software Suite 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, Global Proxy Suite 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 Initiated, architected and executed SOA from concept to completion to facilitate decoupled UI clients, 2 web services and 10 services, and selected hands-on projects include: Hercules web service for web player solution based off MPEG-DASH Created C++ engine to process URI, handle sessions, and deliver segmented MP4 atoms (H.264, AAC) Provides dynamic HTML5 player page; JavaScript source based off dash JS. Supports multiple raster sizes and bit rates; \"ready to go\" and \"just in time\" sessions. Team helped with providing C# web service framework, CLI bridge layer, and device testing. Published functional, REST API, and URI specification document. JSON services on TCP stack using C++ as part of SOA Created API framework classes; multi-threaded server side socket classes. Created header only JSON parser on top of open source \"rapid json\" for SAX style reader. Developed new services: Content Manager, Helper, Picon, and Requestor.

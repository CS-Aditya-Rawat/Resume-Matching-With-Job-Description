Experienced in planning, tracking and executing tasks to meet desired deadlines.\u00c2  Skills Aware of Analog Layout fundamentals like Device matching, shielding, Isolation, ESD, Latchup, Antenna, EM, DFM Physical verification layout using tools like K2Ver, Hercules, Caliber, Assura Used auto routers tools like ICCT, Chip Assembly router, Aprisa, VSR on various blocks to reduce manual effort Used post layout parasitic extraction tools Used \u00c2 Nucleus (TI internal tool for ESD and Latchup), SPIRE (TI internal tool for EMIR analysis), Voltrace (TI internal tool for High voltage \u00c2 checks Used data management tools like Synchronicity and IC manage\u00c2  Relevant Experience Current Company: Aricent Inc. Client:  Intel USA I am currently being trained in Genesys tool and 10nm Intel flow. I am working on blocks like LDO to begin with. Client:  Qualcomm Pvt Ltd India  WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 14FF (Samsung foundry) : Duration of project - 6 months I managed a team of 6 who worked on WTR synth project done in 14FF Samsung foundry. This is one of the most challenging tasks in my career, as this is the first RF task that I have worked in FF technologies. To overcome the challenges I have undergone various FinFet related trainings to understand the process and its impact on layout. Experience Engineering Project Manager   ,  12/2012   to  06/2017   Company Name I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual. I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level. These sheets certainly helped us to plan the next project much better. WTR-RX/TX SYNTH in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 6 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA. My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables. I also handled some portion of the TOP level layout tasks. I worked on blocks like HFVCO, Regulator, VCO Buffer and LPF during this project. I used Gantt chart to schedule the tasks for each individual. I also used XL sheet to track the progress and issues on a more micro level. WTR QLNA Daisy Chain 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months For this particular project I had regular discussions with the Packaging team to create the best Daisy Chain structures for a WLP CHIP which I had work on previously. I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB. WTR QLNA Metal Variants Tapeout 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 0.5 months We needed metal variants for the QLNA chip which I previously worked on. In design we leave scope for meal options which can be used to study certain features better during testing. Here I worked on creating four chips with different metal variant options. I also went through the entire process of Tape Out of this CHIP which included uploaded Tapeout related files to the database and reviewing the eJV sent to the FAB. WTR QLNA in 180nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 5 months This was my first project in 180nm TSMC process. In this project I mentored one other junior in my team who worked on MBIAS block while I worked in creating the LNA. WTR RX BBF in 28nm (TSMC/UMC) : Duration of project - 4 months I lead a team of 4 which supported a project which was being done at Qualcomm USA. My role in this project was to have regular discussion with US designers to understand their requirements, later communicate these requirements with my team and also track the deliverables using Gantt chart and XL sheet. I worked on the top level and few sub-blocks of BBF in this project. WTR FBRX in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 4 months This task was about working on FBRX module which was previously done. There we few issues seen with this blocks performance in post silicon verifications. My role in this task was to identify the IQ imbalance which caused performance issues and fix them. I was able to meet the designers requirements in this task and was very much appreciated by him once the task was done. WTR Low Band Low Noise Amplifier 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 3 months This is a Low Band LNA which operates between 860 - 900 Mhz frequencies. Here layout constraints like coupling, inductance and symmetry were taken care while doing layout. Majorly the input devices to which RF_IN signal were given extra care w.r.t coupling and symmetry. WTR Mixer, Attenuator in 28nm (TSMC) : Duration of project - 10 months This is the first project which I worked on in RF domain and I had a wonderful experience working on this project. The blocks that I worked in this project were for a product chip and hence the amount of learning was tremendous in this project. The blocks were ready on time with good quality.

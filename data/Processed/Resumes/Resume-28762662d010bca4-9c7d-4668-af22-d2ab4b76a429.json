Relevant Experience REST API and URI specification document for Hercules web service. Reuse Innovation\" award at Harris Corporation for reuse of the core IP from NLE product suite in Nexio server product suite. The editing IP reuse contributed to the Server business unit turnaround. Consistent \"role model\" performance review during principal engineer years. Certified ScrumMaster, Scrum Alliance, Dec 2014 - Dec 2016. Products: . Experience Software Engineering Manager   September 2009   to  Current   Company Name   \u00ef\u00bc  City   ,  State Limited: C#, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript. BCD of Harris Corporation spinoff as Imagine in 2013) Nexio video servers and applications facilitate collaborative workflow in Nexio LAN with video servers, services and applications running in various nodes. Media comes from proprietary SAN or generic storage off NAS. Development and team management, Nexio servers' applications, Playout business unit: Relocated from IL to CA, took on larger role, and video server applications product suite as well. Led team of 6 from Northridge, team of 8 from Naperville, and team of 8 (indirect report) from Beijing. Scrum development methods since 2014, team of 3 to 6 from Burbank; Naperville office closed in 2013. Team migrated source revision control to Mercurial / Jenkins. Led SOA initiative from concept to completion, 2 web services, 10 JSON services, and decoupled UI layers. Released deliverables for Nexio Software Suite 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, Global Proxy Suite 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 Major hands-on projects include: Hercules, web service for web player solution, based off MPEG-DASH Hosts player URI, provides REST API, and delivers fragmented MP4 atoms (H.264 video, AAC audio). Provides HTML5 player page, and JavaScript source based off dash JS. Supports multiple source types, and \"ready to go\" and \"just in time\" sessions. C# web service framework API layer bridges with unmanaged C++ engine via managed C++ CLI layer. Team helped with providing web service framework, CLI layer, and device testing. JSON services on TCP stack using C++ JSON protocol API framework classes; multi-threaded server side socket classes. JSON routines, header only parser solution on top of open source \"rapid json\". JSON protosim, common unit test application for all JSON services. New services: Content Manager, Helper, Picon, and Requestor. Evolved as services: Encoder, GPRX, Helios, MB, Scavenger, and Transcoder. Guided services GPRX, Helper and Requestor to completion. Content Manager service Rules based engine to manage media contents, and metadata updates between two domains. Successfully deployed to manage primary-backup workflows, and storage migration needs. NX-theme DLL, skinning SDK (C++, MFC) Applied selective API detour, Window procedure intercept, and application message queue intercept. Accomplished consistent look and feel of GUI, and team applied this SDK to multiple GUI products. Transcoder, Scavenger, applications for low-res proxy creations (C++, threads, TCP, binary protocol) Needed solution to improve legacy products that required regular hand holding. Teamed up, took new approach, and successfully wrote two new products to manage escalation. MediaBase DLL, Nexio explorer (C++, MFC) Guided to optimize original implementation for support up to 200K IDs. Achieved constant UI performance under few milliseconds regardless of user operation. Initiated to introduce \"dta-handler\" architecture in ftp-server product Approach helped to consolidate all media formats as one product build, and scalability. Team added one converter DLL per media container format for import and export.

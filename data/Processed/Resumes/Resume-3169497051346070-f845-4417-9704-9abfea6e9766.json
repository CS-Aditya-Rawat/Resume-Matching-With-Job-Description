Exceptional project management skills utilizing customer commitment, team work, communication, planning and organization to achieve excellence. Skills C#, ASP.NET, Visual Basic, Ms Visual Studio, Ms Office Suite (Word, Excel, Project, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook, Visio), Simulations using Witness13 and SIMIO, ERP-SAP, SAS-STAT, AutoCAD Accomplishments Liaised with [group] to modify and improve overall product performance. Eliminated machine defects through recommendation of machine adjustments. Prepared plans and layouts for equipment or system arrangements and space allocation. Prepared sheet metal fabrication drawings, modifications and commercial specification drawings in compliance with industry standards. Met with customers to help design custom entertainment centers, china cabinets, mantels and kitchen cabinets for residential homes. Supervised and directed over 25 employees on electronics designs that resulted in production yield improvement which later translated into $200K in company revenue. Supervised project production efforts to ensure projects were completed to company standards, on time and within budget constraints. Created presentation materials for sales, customer relations and management purposes. Tested equipment to ensure compliance. Analyzed data and provided recommendations which resulted in adoption of new cost-saving equipment. Saved 14% on supply costs by working closely with suppliers to ensure components met department quality standards. Performed data collection and statistical analysis that resulted in sound recommendations that were adopted by department. Professional Experience Industrial Engineering Intern   08/2014   to  12/2014   Company Name   City   ,  State Successfully re-designed and re-developed existing company labor system application using Visual Basic 6 that resulted in additional functions that aid labor hours update and easy computation of staff payroll.

Below are some details on my position at Stanbury Electrical Engineering. Typed and organized the binders stating everything there is to know about the chargers for meetings with potential buyers. Patiently and carefully put the \"stickers\" together through the sticker process. Stickers\" meaning the logo for the chargers. Then, I lined up the stickers once they were completed and gently put it on the charger itself. Rendered technical drawings and electrical systems specifications that exceeded company standards.

Organized makeup/hair display. Test-dummy for spa-related activities (Facials/nails)  BigFoot Java (24 hours I took on the role as both a normal Barista (4am-10am, 10am- 4pm, 4pm-10pm), as well as the Graveyard Barista (10pm-4am).

Still, if it works with my schedule and they need an emergency nanny, I'll be there for them. Started at either 7am or 10am, ended at either 7pm or later if they had a date night. They have two little boys. Ryan (age 2) and Nathan (age 5) On the way to work for Kelly, she would drop off Nathan at pre-school. I would watch/care for Ryan until 11:30, then I got him ready to get in the car to go pick up big brother from school on Bellevue way. When we got back from picking up Nathan, I would feed them lunch. Made them dinner. Made sure they had good hygiene. They weren't allowed much screen time (television or online games, etc.) so we mostly did critical thinking activities such as reading and writing and art. Played active games, took them to parks in Seattle, North Bend, Bellevue, and Issaquah. Put the boys to sleep at night. Watched over their house & fed their cat when they went on long vacations. Cleaned up their house every visit.

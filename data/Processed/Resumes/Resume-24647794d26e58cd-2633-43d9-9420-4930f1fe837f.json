Accomplishments IEEE Robot Competition  Systems Design (CAPSTONE)  Spring 2013 - spring 2014   Collaborated with a team of 4 engineering students in the design and implementation of an autonomous robot that has to detect an oil rig on \"fire\", select and transport a specific tool in order to extinguish the fire Lead the mechanical design of the robot; both chassis and robotic arm parts with 3-D printing technology and SolidWorks software. Acquired experience with the mechanical shop equipment and lab instruments while producing mechanical components and implementing and assembling electrical circuits. Acquired experience using the product development life cycle and risk assessment. Gained experience in the integration of the hardware and software subsystems and the testing process of the design. Competed in the 2014 IEEE Region V robotics competition. Spectrum Analyzer  Real Time Signal Processing  Fall 2013 Programmed a C6713 DSK board and implemented a digital Spectrum Analyzer. The program was written using Code Composer studio and the UI was developed in Visual Basics Used the Software development lifecycle to develop the software of the system. Built the UI using Visual Basics.NET. Guitar Tuner  Digital Signal Processing  Spring 2013 \u00c2\u00b7 Engineered a guitar tuner implemented by programming a C6713 DSK board. Designed analog filters and digital filters to remove noise in an audio file using algorithms developed with Matlab and Simulink. Laser Project  Computer Systems  Spring 2013 \u00c2\u00b7 Created a compact computer system that controls and animates letters on a wall. Implemented the hardware schematics developed in assembly language on a MC68HC11 microprocessor. Acquired much experience in troubleshooting the system using a logic analyzer and oscilloscope. Professional Experience Company Name   July 2015 Conducted a successful research project on innovative use of Active Noise Control (ANC), 3-D Noise Mapping and Passive Noise Control systems as a solution for acoustical noise control issues in fast growing cities. Company Name   October 2014 Successfully engineered a new transmission line to feed a new load in a city's transmission system using PowerWorld simulation software, and ETAP. Performed Three-Phase Power Systems circuit analysis of the new system. Performed cost analysis and allocation for the project. Company Name   September 2014   to  August 2015   Engineering Intern   Lead AutoCAD Drafting team of 3 in drafting 2D maps of Oil and Gas production sites. Contributed in building Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plans for Oil and Gas Production Facilities, data entry, and various office duties assigned by my manager. Enhanced my communication and leadership skills within my team and my manager.

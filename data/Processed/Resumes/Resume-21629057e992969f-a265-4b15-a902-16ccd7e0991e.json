    "clean_data": "ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN/ FIELD SERVICE Professional Summary Results-driven and focused Engineering Technician who prioritizes safety, cost-effective solutions and exceeding customer expectations. With my background in both Field Service and as an Engineering Technician. I was able to effectively reduce test and production time through gaining a true understanding for the process without sacrificing quality. Long term goals , become an intuitive I/E Technician in the pulp and paper industry, teach others with the potential to take on a leadership role within my first 5 years Skills Operational analysis Exceptional time management Geometric dimensioning Strong leader Manufacturing process controls Detail-oriented Analog and digital circuitry Detail drawings Comfortable working at heights and odd locations  Technical plan execution aptitude Detail-oriented understanding that any downtime must be minimized if not avoidable  Understand overtime and on-call basis may be required Rigging  Soldering, Drilling- Tapping Measurement and layout Test and measurement equipment Equipment calibration Tenacity , willingness to go to whatever length it takes to solve a problem or improve a process Work History Engineering Technician/ Field Service   May 1994   -  May 2000   Company Name   City   ,  State   Developed and built, complex RF systems for broadcasters worldwide. Tested at the component level and built the systems Worked closely with the staff engineers and engineering department as well as customers to be certain the end users needs were met. I was also responsible for equipment maintenance and calibrations being kept up to date. I was also responsible for the low voltage control wiring for protection circuitry and system operations both as components and at a system level. Field service engineering, install and provide proof of performance to the end user and transmitter manufacturer, Some of my field work was on an emergent basis due to equipment failure or improper operation. Sales to the broadcaster. Also provided feedback to our engineering department for proper record keeping. Limited machine shop work in model making for R&D projects. Interfaced with other suppliers and the respective engineering departments to ensure proper operation. Implemented schematics, diagrams and written and verbal descriptions to effectively solve engineering project issues. Completed projects by effectively applying engineering, technical and maintenance procedures. Used precision test equipment such as oscilloscopes, multi-meters, waveform generators and spectrum analyzers  Collaborated with engineers at the new product introduction phase to develop and verify design changes. Initiated contact with vendors and built solid working relationships with them. Followed up on manufacturing and field reports and resolved outstanding problems. Compiled, processed and analyzed test data and results to improve product quality. Engineering technician  Jun 1988   -  Jun 1994   Company Name   City   ,  State   Research and Development of components for the broadcasters, Developed new product line for MCI. Field service engineering, Wiring of microprocessor controlled RF systems and system assembly and tests, modeling and design of some components working with the engineers and drafting department. Responsible for installation and proof of performance test, as well as repair of products at the customer's site. Feed back provided to the engineering departments well as training for the end user, Made sure the manuals were up to date and accurate, some sales of new products and often times working with the engineers within other companies to resolve engineering issues as they arose in the field. Responsible for maintaining the calibration of test equipment. Major accomplishments Improved product quality by customizing tools and eliminating variability. Followed up on manufacturing and field reports and resolved outstanding problems. Conducted engineering and detailed experimental tests to collect design data and assist in research work.

Control wiring and protection circuitry, Customer service skills. Served as an interface between engineering and production departments.  Other basic skills: wiring, drilling and tapping, soldering, layout and installation of new equipment, wiring of motor controls. I am able to think on my feet, under pressure and deadlines, while keeping multiple projects going. The ability to follow thru and work under pressure has given me the ability to meet emergent needs. Handling critical situations has always been my specialty. The ability to learn and absorb new information has been continually proven through past work experience and current education. Proven leader. Keeping up with current standards and methods thru on going school and keeping up with industry thru current publications. Just finished Geometry and Trigonometry as well as collage English. I am currently enrolled and nearly finished with Process measurement, Industrial controls along with Industrial robotics and Electronic devices (amplifier circuitry). I am willing to relocate as needed. The Veteran's Administration is backing both my education and return to the workforce. I can and will be a great asset to any company you may place me with.

I try to be certain the\ncustomer's needs are met to the highest standards. Professional attitude and open mind to learning new concepts and ideas as well as new\nproducts. Control wiring and protection circuitry, Customer service skills. Served as an interface between engineering and production\ndepartments. \nOther basic skills: wiring, drilling and tapping, soldering, layout and installation of new equipment, wiring of motor controls. I\nam able to think on my feet, under pressure and deadlines, while keeping multiple projects going. The ability to follow thru and work under\npressure has given me the ability to meet emergent needs. Handling critical situations has always been my specialty. The ability to learn and\nabsorb new information has been continually proven through past work experience and current education. Proven leader. Keeping up with\ncurrent standards and methods thru on going school and keeping up with industry thru current publications. Just finished Geometry and\nTrigonometry as well as collage English. I am currently enrolled and nearly finished with Process measurement, Industrial controls along with\nIndustrial robotics and Electronic devices (amplifier circuitry). I am willing to relocate as needed. The Veteran's Administration is backing\nboth my education and return to the workforce. I can and will be a great asset to any company you may place me with. Long term goals,\nteach and manage others and to find my place within industry.",
